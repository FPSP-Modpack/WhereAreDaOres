# WhereAreTheOres?

This mod is and addon for [NotEnoughItems](https://github.com/Chicken-Bones/NotEnoughItems). It is intended for modpack makers, who love to shuffle the ore generation around or just want a better experience for their players.

So what does this do? You can look up the recipe of any ore and see, in which dimensions it generates and other details, like max vein size or the y-range. This Information must first be configured via an easy-to-use JSON-file. Further Information on how to do this can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/FPSP-Modpack/WhereAreTheOres/wiki/The-Configuration-File).

mitchej123's [updated NotEnoughItems](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/NotEnoughItems) is supported.

This mod is client-side only!
